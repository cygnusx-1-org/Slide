# Issues
In any project it's likely that a few bugs will slip through the cracks, so it
helps greatly if people document any bugs they find to ensure that they get
fixed promptly.

You can view a list of known issues and feature requests using
[the issue tracker](https://github.com/edgan/Slide/issues).
If you don't see your issue (or you aren't sure), feel free to
[submit it!](https://github.com/edgan/Slide/issues/new).

Where appropriate, a screenshot works wonders to help us see exactly what the
issue is. You can upload screenshots directly using the GitHub issue tracker or
by attaching a link (to Imgur, for example), whichever is easier for you.
